Hack Night
-----------
This application was developed in Hack Night , a fun coding weekend . This project is only for educational purposes .


Installation
----------
On one session  
> $ python server.py

Another session

Working
----------
Sockets and OpenCV are two main things in this app. 

Client connects to server socket . PyOpenCV library is used to retrieve frames from webcam feed , they are compressed to jpg to save on the amount of data to be sent across the socket and transmitted . At the other end the image is decompressed and shown. The data being well above 4096 is sent split and reassembled at the other end .

PS : This implementation is two way
